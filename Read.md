# UX & Frontend Assessment Project

This repository contains my submission for the frontend assessment.

## About this project
This project was built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The goal of the assessment was to implement the provided design and functionality as accurately as possible within the given time.

## Use of AI tools
I used AI tools (such as ChatGPT) in a limited way to assist with:
- Clarifying certain JavaScript logic
- Improving code structure and readability
- Debugging small issues

All core implementation, layout, styling, and functionality were written and assembled by me.  
The AI was used as a support tool, not to generate the full solution.

## Current state
This repository reflects the most complete version of the project I was able to deliver within the allotted time.  
Some parts may still be improvable, but this shows my approach, structure, and problem-solving process.

## How to run
